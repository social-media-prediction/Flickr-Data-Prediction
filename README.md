## Temporal Popularity Image Collection (TPIC)
TPIC is an image popularity dataset with multi-faceted information, such as user profile, photo metadata, and visual content. It includes 68k user album images with user meta information from over 10 years time-line. Also, we provide normalized label for the convenience to improve data integrity.  It contains 680K photos in total over three years from Flickr. In order to use the temporal information from the dataset, we extracted time information from the metadata. To ensure the generalizability of our results, we sampled 100K, 200K and 400K photos with time-order.
