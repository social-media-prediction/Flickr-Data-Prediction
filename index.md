## TPIC2017 - Temporal Popularity Image Collection

### A social media dataset for temporal popularity prediction

For temporal prediction on popularity, TPIC is an temporal image popularity dataset with 680K photos and corresponding anoynimized photo-sharing records on Flickr ranges of 3 years. Specifically, TPIC is also a multi-faceted data collection, which contains photo image, user profile and photo metadata. We provide the popularity as the normalized views of each photo sharing behaviors. In order to protect the private information of sharing behaviors, we convert the timestamps to segmented time information and indexed of it by integer numbers. To ensure the generalizability of our results, we sampled 100K, 200K and 400K photos with time-order.
